# Contributing to Workflow Template

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This template aims to help teams work effectively with AI coding agents.

## Setup

For the best experience with this workflow template:

### Required

- **VS Code 1.107+** (November 2025 release or later)
- GitHub Copilot extension

### Recommended Settings

Enable the built-in GitHub MCP server for seamless issue and PR workflows:

```json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.githubMcpServer.enabled": true
}
```

This enables agents to interact directly with GitHub issues and PRs without external MCP server configuration.

## Ways to Contribute

1. Check [existing issues](../../issues) first
2. Open a new issue with:
   - Clear description of the problem
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Your environment details

### Suggest Improvements

Have ideas for better prompts or workflows?

1. Open a [discussion](../../discussions) to gather feedback
2. If there's consensus, create an issue
3. Reference the discussion in your PR

### Submit Pull Requests

Ready to contribute code or documentation?

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/improvement-name`)
3. Make your changes
