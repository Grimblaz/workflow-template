# Skill Creator

Guide for creating new skills with proper structure and VS Code 1.107+ compatible frontmatter.

## When to Use

- Creating a new skill for the project
- Reviewing existing skills for compliance
- Updating skill templates
- Onboarding contributors to skill creation

## Required Frontmatter Format

```markdown
---
name: skill-name-kebab-case
description: What the skill does AND when to use it. This description triggers skill discovery in chat.
---
```

**Important**: 
- `name` and `description` are the only supported frontmatter fields
- No `allowed-tools` or other fields—they will be ignored
- Description should include usage triggers for discoverability

## Directory Structure

```
.claude/skills/
└── {skill-name}/
    ├── SKILL.md          # Required: Main skill file with frontmatter
    ├── reference.md      # Optional: Detailed reference material
    ├── templates.md      # Optional: Code/document templates
    └── examples/         # Optional: Example files
        └── ...
```

## Skill Template

```markdown
---
name: {skill-name}
description: {What it does}. Use when {trigger conditions}.
---

# {Skill Title}

Brief overview of the skill's purpose.

## When to Use

- Bullet list of situations
- That trigger this skill
- Be specific for discoverability

## Core Content

Main guidance, principles, or process.

### Subsections as Needed

Organize by user goals, not by internal structure.

## Project-Specific Configuration

[CUSTOMIZE] Add project-specific details:
- Configuration files to modify
- Team conventions to follow
- Tools and paths used

## Quick Reference

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Key concept | Brief explanation |

## See Also

- [Related supporting file](./related-file.md)
- External reference links
```

## Writing Guidelines

### Description Field (Critical for Discovery)

The description determines when the skill appears in suggestions.

**Good descriptions**:
```yaml
description: Structured debugging process using observe-hypothesize-test-fix methodology. Use when debugging complex issues, investigating flaky tests, or tracking down root causes.

description: Guide for resilient UI component testing. Use when writing React tests, fixing flaky tests, or reviewing test code.
```

**Bad descriptions**:
```yaml
description: Debugging guide.  # Too vague, poor discoverability

description: This skill helps with testing things.  # Unclear scope
```

### Content Principles

1. **Be actionable**: Provide steps, not just concepts
2. **Use `[CUSTOMIZE]` markers**: For project-specific placeholders
3. **Keep SKILL.md concise**: Route to supporting files for details
4. **Template-generic language**: No repo-specific references
5. **Include "When to Use"**: Explicit trigger conditions

### Customization Markers

Use `[CUSTOMIZE]` for sections that need project adaptation:

```markdown
## Project Configuration

[CUSTOMIZE] Add your project's specific:
- File paths and locations
- Naming conventions
- Team-specific practices
```

## Skill Sizing Guidelines

| Size | SKILL.md Lines | Supporting Files | Use Case |
|------|----------------|------------------|----------|
| Small | 50-100 | 0 | Simple process or checklist |
| Medium | 100-200 | 0-1 | Standard methodology |
| Large | 150-250 | 1-3 | Complex topic with patterns |

**Rule**: If SKILL.md exceeds 300 lines, split into supporting files.

## Validation Checklist

Before committing a new skill:

- [ ] Frontmatter has only `name` and `description`
- [ ] `name` is kebab-case
- [ ] `description` includes usage triggers
- [ ] "When to Use" section is present
- [ ] `[CUSTOMIZE]` markers for project-specific content
- [ ] No hardcoded paths or repo-specific references
- [ ] Supporting files are referenced from SKILL.md
- [ ] Content is actionable, not just conceptual

## Example: Complete Skill

```markdown
---
name: code-review
description: Structured code review process with security and maintainability focus. Use when reviewing PRs, conducting code audits, or establishing review standards.
---

# Code Review Skill

Systematic approach to reviewing code changes.

## When to Use

- Reviewing pull requests
- Conducting security audits
- Establishing team review standards
- Self-review before submitting PRs

## Review Process

### 1. Understand Context
- Read PR description and linked issues
- Understand the goal before reading code

### 2. High-Level Review
- Does the approach make sense?
- Are there architectural concerns?

### 3. Detailed Review
- Security: Input validation, auth, data exposure
- Correctness: Edge cases, error handling
- Maintainability: Readability, naming, complexity

### 4. Provide Feedback
- Be specific and actionable
- Suggest alternatives, don't just criticize
- Distinguish blocking vs. non-blocking

## Project Standards

[CUSTOMIZE] Add your team's review requirements:
- Required reviewers by area
- Review checklist items
- Auto-merge criteria
