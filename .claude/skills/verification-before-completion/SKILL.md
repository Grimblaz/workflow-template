# Verification Before Completion

Systematic verification process to ensure work is truly complete.

## When to Use

- Before creating a pull request
- Before marking a ticket/issue as done
- Before declaring a feature complete
- Before releases or deployments
- Anytime you think "I'm done"

## Core Principle

> "Done" means verified, not just implemented.

The gap between "I wrote the code" and "it works correctly" is where bugs hide.

## Universal Verification Checklist

### 1. Requirements Verification
- [ ] Re-read the original requirements/ticket
- [ ] All acceptance criteria explicitly met
- [ ] Edge cases identified and handled
- [ ] No scope creep (didn't add unrequested features)
- [ ] No scope miss (didn't forget requested features)

### 2. Code Quality Verification
- [ ] Code compiles/runs without errors
- [ ] No new warnings introduced
- [ ] Linter passes with no new issues
- [ ] Follows project code style
- [ ] No debug code left (console.log, TODO hacks)

### 3. Testing Verification
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New tests written for new code
- [ ] Tests cover happy path
- [ ] Tests cover error/edge cases
- [ ] Manual testing performed in realistic environment

### 4. Integration Verification
- [ ] Works with rest of system (not just in isolation)
- [ ] Database migrations work (up AND down)
- [ ] API contracts honored
- [ ] No breaking changes to dependents
- [ ] Feature flags configured if needed

### 5. Documentation Verification
- [ ] Code comments for complex logic
- [ ] README updated if needed
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] Changelog entry added
- [ ] Migration/upgrade notes if needed

## Quick Verification Commands

```bash
[CUSTOMIZE] Add your project's verification commands:

# Run all checks
npm run verify        # or: make verify, ./verify.sh

# Individual checks
npm run lint          # Static analysis
npm run test          # Unit tests
npm run test:e2e      # Integration tests
npm run build         # Ensure it builds
```

## Context-Specific Checklists

### Before Pull Request
- [ ] Branch is up to date with target
- [ ] Commit messages are clear
- [ ] PR description explains the change
- [ ] Screenshots/videos if UI change
- [ ] Reviewers assigned
- [ ] Labels/tags applied

### Before Release
- [ ] All PRs merged and verified
- [ ] Release notes complete
- [ ] Version numbers updated
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Stakeholders notified
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured

### Before Demo
- [ ] Feature works end-to-end
- [ ] Test data is realistic
- [ ] Environment is stable
- [ ] Backup demo path ready
- [ ] Talking points prepared

## Evidence Collection

Don't just check boxes—collect evidence:

### Acceptable Evidence
- ✅ Screenshot of passing tests
- ✅ Link to successful CI/CD run
- ✅ Screen recording of feature working
- ✅ Query results showing correct data
- ✅ Logs showing expected behavior

### Insufficient Evidence
- ❌ "I tested it locally" (no proof)
- ❌ "It worked yesterday" (not now)
- ❌ "The tests pass" (which tests?)
- ❌ "I didn't change that" (verify anyway)

## Verification Log Template

```markdown
## Verification: [Ticket/Feature ID]

### Requirements Review
- [x] Requirement 1: [How verified]
- [x] Requirement 2: [How verified]

### Tests
- Unit tests: [Link to CI run]
- Integration: [Link or screenshot]
- Manual: [Description of what tested]

### Evidence
- [Screenshot/link 1]
- [Screenshot/link 2]

### Notes
- [Any caveats or known limitations]

Verified by: [Name]
Date: [Date]
```

## Common "Almost Done" Traps

| Trap | Reality Check |
|------|---------------|
| "Works on my machine" | Did you test in CI/staging? |
| "Just needs review" | Did YOU review it first? |
| "Tests pass" | Do tests cover the change? |
| "Same as before" | Did you verify it still works? |
| "Simple change" | Simple changes cause outages |
| "Just a refactor" | Refactors can change behavior |

## When NOT Done

Stop and address if:
- Any test is failing (even "unrelated" ones)
- Any warning you don't understand
- Any TODO/FIXME you added
- Any hardcoded value that should be config
- Any "I'll fix it later" thought

## Project-Specific Requirements

[CUSTOMIZE] Add your project's completion criteria:

```markdown
## Definition of Done

### Code
- [ ] [Project-specific coding standard]
- [ ] [Required review process]

### Testing
- [ ] [Minimum coverage requirement]
- [ ] [Required test types]

### Documentation
- [ ] [Required documentation updates]

### Process
- [ ] [Required approvals]
- [ ] [Required notifications]
```
